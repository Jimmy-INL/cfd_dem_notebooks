    "From Hooke's law and [Hertz theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Classical_solutions_for_non-adhesive_elastic_contact), and following [2] (eq. 43), we can relate some particle properties to the contact model parameters:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$k_n = \\frac{2ER_{eff}}{3(1-\\sigma^2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_{eff}=\\frac{R_i R_j}{R_i +R_j}$ is the effective radius, $E_i$ is the Young's modulus of the material $i$ and $\\sigma_i$ its Poisson ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for two spheres of the same radius $R$ colliding at the relative velocity $v_0$, it is not difficult to show that $e_n = e^{- \\gamma_n \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\gamma_n^2}}}$ where $\\gamma_n$ is the normal dynamic friction coefficient, $e_n$ is the normal restitution coefficient and $\\omega_0=\\frac{2 k_n}{M}$ is the resonance pulsation of the system, with $M$ being the mass of each sphere. We could also express the latter in terms of $\\gamma_n$:\n",
    "$$\\gamma_n = -\\frac{\\omega_0 ln(e_n)}{\\sqrt{\\pi^2 + (ln(e_n))^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, setting $k_n$ to its physical value implies that $\\Delta t$ is ridiculously small ($\\Delta t \\approx 10^{-9}$ s), and performing reliable DEM simulations can seem out of reach at first. However, it has been shown [2,3] that the normal stiffness $k_n$ does not play a significant role in the overall dynamics of the system, and that decreasing its value by two to four orders of magnitudes $-$ depending on the system $-$ can be safely performed."
