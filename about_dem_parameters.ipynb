    "Now, for two spheres of the same radius $R$ colliding at the relative velocity $v_0$, it is not difficult to show that $e_n = e^{- \\gamma_n \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\gamma_n^2}}}$ where $\\gamma_n$ is the normal dynamic friction coefficient, $e_n$ is the normal restitution coefficient and $\\omega_0=\\frac{2 k_n}{M}$ is the resonance pulsation of the system, with $M$ being the mass of each sphere. We could also express the latter in terms of $\\gamma_n$:\n",

    "Unfortunately, setting $k_n$ to its physical value implies that $\\Delta t$ is ridiculously small ($\\Delta t \\approx 10^{-9}$ s), and performing reliable DEM simulations can seem out of reach at first. However, it has been shown [2,3] that the normal stiffness $k_n$ does not play a significant role in the overall dynamics of the system, and that decreasing its value by two to four orders of magnitudes $-$ depending on the system $-$ can be safely performed."
